EnterpriseBSD Guide
===================

The BSDs (Dragonfly, Free, Net, Open) contain many mature and tested features which "enterprises" of any size can use: storage, virtualization, networking, high-availabity etc. The BSD manual pages are well regarded, even by non-BSD users.However, the man pages can be terse and do not address all situations. There are attempts by users to contribute additional documentation in the forms of HOWTOs and blogs.  Other sources of documentation is contained in mailing lists, Stackoverflow questions and answers, and varous forum posts across the internet. However, because many home users do not use these advanced features, the questions, forum posts, and blogs do not exist. This site is a humble attempt at documenting in greater detail these features and how users --from the hobbyist to the starup DevOp to the corporate SysAdmin-- can put the built-in features of the BSDs to work in their environments.

As an advanced warning or disclaimer: my experience is heavily weighted towards FreeBSD, the first iterations of the content on this site will be exclusivly FreeBSD-based. As my experience with the features of other BSDs grow, I aim to incorporate that knowledged here as well.
