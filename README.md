The *BSDs (Free, Open, Net, Dragonfly) and derivitives have many mature and tested features which can be used by "enterprises" of any size: storage, virtualization, networking, high-availabity etc. Much of the existing documentation on these features is contained in mailing lists, stackoverflow questions and answers, and varous forum posts across the internet. This site is a humble attempt at collecting all these diseperate sources and approaches into a single location.

As my experience is heavily weighted towards FreeBSD, the first iterations of the content on this site will be exclusivly FreeBSD-based. As my experience with the features of other BSDs grow, I aim to incorporate that knowledged here as well.
